#Following Links in Python
#In this assignment you will write a Python program that expands on http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/urllinks.py. 
#The program will use urllib to read the HTML from the data files below, extract the href= vaues from the anchor tags, 
#scan for a tag that is in a particular position relative to the first name in the list, 
#follow that link and repeat the process a number of times and report the last name you find.

import urllib2
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = raw_input("Enter URL: ")
count = int(raw_input("Enter count: "))
position = int(raw_input("Enter position: "))

names = []

while count > 0:
    print "retrieving: {0}".format(url)
    page = urllib2.urlopen(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(page)
    anchors = soup('a')
    name = anchors[position-1].string
    names.append(name)
    url = anchors[position-1]['href']
    count -= 1

print names[-1]
